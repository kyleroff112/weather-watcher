# Weather Watcher

This is a simple weather app that allows you to search for the current weather and a 5-day forecast for any city. The app uses the OpenWeather API to get the weather data.

To use the app, simply enter the name of a city in the search box and click the "Submit" button. The app will display the current weather for the city, including an icon, description, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. You can also click the "5-Day Forecast" button to see the forecast for the next 5 days.
